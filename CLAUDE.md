# jt-portfolio — working rules

The live site is **uxjon.com** (the Studio redesign, shipped Aug 2026). Fuller
history and the open-items list live in Claude's file memory
(`portfolio_studio_reapproach` and `resume_experience`); this file is the
repo-local contract every session must follow.

## Branch + deploy model
- **main = production.** Vercel auto-deploys `origin/main`. Never commit to
  main directly; work on `studio-desk` (this worktree,
  `~/sites/jt-portfolio-studio`) and ship via fast-forward merge from the main
  checkout (`~/sites/jt-portfolio`), then verify uxjon.com actually serves the
  change before calling it shipped.
- Push to prod only when Jon says so.

## Verification norms (non-negotiable)
- Build gate: `source ~/.nvm/nvm.sh; npm run build > /tmp/build.log 2>&1; echo "exit: $?"`
  — judge ONLY the exit code; grepping the log for "error" gives false passes.
- Dev server: preview name `studio-desk`, port **4631** (global launch.json).
  Never run dev servers via plain Bash.
- Browser verification: the CDP harness at `~/studio-mocks/cdp.mjs`
  (`launch(port)` → `{cdp, ev, close}`; `ev` does NOT await promises;
  screenshots at `result.data`). Always headless and muted.
- **Never engage the instrument's audio in the live preview pane** (offscreen
  Chromium plays Web Audio aloud). Headless only.
- QA by LOOKING at screenshots (including below-the-fold pins), not just DOM
  numbers. Captures go to `~/Documents/studio-build/`.
- After any change, assert `scrollWidth <= viewport` at 375 and 1440 on the
  touched pages — horizontal overflow has been the most-recurring regression.

## Sacred / hazard files
- `src/components/SignalMachine.astro` is **SACRED**: observe it (its root is
  `section#sgm` inside `.sig-desktop`; page-level anchor/spy target is the
  HOST `#play`), style it only from outside, never edit it.
- `src/components/studio/StudioOne.astro`: python start..end splicing has
  repeatedly eaten neighboring blocks. Use anchored exact-string edits, and
  verify every scripted replace actually matched (a silent no-match shipped a
  real bug once). Its nav trio (spy highlight, word map, comet bead) shares
  one source of truth (`getDocIds()` + `fyOf()`); never let them diverge, and
  remember layout order is width-dependent (mobile flex order).

## Résumé subsystem
- `src/lib/resume-print.ts` is the ONLY résumé prose source. The old
  Notion-driven screen résumé is retired; do not resurrect it.
- `/resume` is the annotated sheet: marks + proofs are screen-only; the
  print/ATS contract in `PrintResume.astro` must never regress (verify with
  print emulation + pypdf: exactly 1 page, clean text extraction).
- After ANY résumé content change, regenerate
  `public/jonathan-tollefson-resume.pdf` (headless `Page.printToPDF` of
  /resume with `preferCSSPageSize`, then pypdf page-count check). Fit is
  measured at TRUE print width (~710px content), not screen width.
- Proof numbers come from `src/lib/judge-ledger.json`, a dated snapshot of
  the real harness DB (`~/automation/data/inventory.db` on the M1:
  `mix_judgements` / `mix_jobs` / `mix_variants`). Refresh by re-querying;
  never invent or "round" these numbers.

## Copy + design laws
- Honesty first: no "live"/"the actual" labels over authored data; real
  numbers only; claims a skeptic can check. The naming law: **Finishable**
  with the Catalog / the Studio / the Engineer ("console", "bucket", "crown a
  king" are retired nouns in visible copy).
- Voice: plain, understated, first-person, lowercase chrome, no em dashes in
  résumé/application copy. Jon-voiced surfaces (hero lines, ledes, bio) are
  HIS: draft only when asked, flag as DRAFT, never committee-polish.
- Chrome is quiet IBM Plex Mono; case studies use the `--cs-mono` token.
- Night mode: `html[data-night]`, two sources (manual switch OR instrument
  power). Dark-until-power is lighting only.
